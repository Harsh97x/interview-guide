One of the biggest misconceptions when preparing for software engineering interviews is that you have to get the "right" answer in order to pass the interview.

# Unpacking our assumptions

When someone asks me if they need to get the "right" answer, it tells me they're making a significant (and usually incorrect) assumption: they're assuming a LeetCode-style answer is all about the _solution_.

Believe it or not, interviewers are _humans_. When evaluating potential future colleagues, they're not just thinking, "I only want to work with an absolute stud that gets the answer to this question perfectly." Instead, they're making a more holistic assessment about whether you would be a benefit to the company. Consider how _you'd_ make this assessment: would you hire someone who's a total jerk but answered a technical question perfectly? Probably not. You'd take much more into consideration than technical performance.
