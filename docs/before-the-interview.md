# Communication Before the Interview

- Mostly with recruiters
- With respect to interviews, recruiters are your friends. They want you to do well. (note they are not necessarily your friends when it comes to salary negotiation, but that's out of scope for this handbook)
- Overcommunicate always
- Be enthusiastic and appreciative of the recruiter. The work with candidates all day every day. Consider the conscious and subconscious ways recruiters can help or hurt your chances.
- Confirm interview time, location, dress code
- If virtual, get meeting links and download any required software
- If virtual, ask what environment you'll be using and practice with it
- Confirm your interview a couple days ahead of time
