# Preparing mentally

- Software development interviewing is broken
- Bias towards people who have time to prepare
- Still, we must play the game
- Understand your goals
- Know that you're making a time-boxed commitment
- Make a schedule so it's time-boxed stress
- Make sure family is good with the commitment
- Reframe thinking around failure
