# Values Interviews

- Similar to, but not to be confused with, behaviorals interviews
- Often, these will be combined
- Company values
- Research these. Have stories to tell.
- Be honest
- If your values don't actually align with the company's values, you probably shouldn't be applying there (unless this is just a practice interview)

- How to prepare
  - Print out/write down a list of the company's values
  - Map the company values to your experiences
