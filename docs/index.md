# Preface

## Welcome to InterviewHandbook.dev!

My name is Nick and I'm a senior software engineer at Microsoft. I have participated in dozens of software engineering interviews on both sides of the table&mdash;as a candidate and an interviewer. I have passed interviews at both big tech/FAANG companies as well as smaller startups.

This handbook is my attempt to codify my learnings about software engineering interviews for the benefit of the software development community. This resouce is, and will always be, free of charge.

## Target audience

This handbook is directed at both new and experienced software engineering candidates. It focuses on individual contributor (IC) engineering rather than engineering management. If you are interviewing for engineering management positions, there may be still be some beneficial sections of this guide; however, much of it may not be applicable.

## How to read this handbook

This handbook isn't _too_ long, so my recommendation is to read it front-to-back at first. There are a lot of concepts that I believe will just "stick" once you read them. During your studies, I recommend you check back to certain sections of the handbook to refresh your memory.

## ðŸš§ Under construction!

This handbook will always be a work in progress. Please give me some grace if you feel like I haven't covered a topic adequately or if you feel like my advice is wrong. I have a [page for feedback](./feedback) and would appreciate any feedback you have!
