# Questions for the Company

- Hopefully every interviewer you speak with (or almost every one) will give you a chance to ask questions
- This is a great opportunity to learn about the company and whether you would want to work there
- Not having questions prepared is a red flag

- Things to ask

  - Domain-specific. Also personal.
  - Sound processes (how is the project managed, how to features make it into production, how do bug fixes make it into produciton, CI/CD, automated testing)
  - What was something interesting they worked on recently
  - What are their biggest challenges right now
  - Anything else

- Leave this part of the conversation with them thinking "they're interested in working here" and you having enough information to actually make that determination.
