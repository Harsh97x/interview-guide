# Communication During the Interview

- Very, very, very important
- They are trying to see what kind of colleague / employee you would be. How do you think they'd feel if:
  - you're cracking under pressure
  - you're a jerk
  - you don't handle ambiguous problems well
  - you don't talk at all when you're trying to solve problems
- I think I got suboptimal solutions on every FAANG coding challenge, but because of my practised communication, I got an offer.
- Every company (and every interviewer) consciously and subconsciously values communication skills differently. There are plenty of people who will fail you on an interview even if you get the most optimal solution but you're a total jerk.

- Thank your interviewer! Interviewing is hard.

- Things to practice:
  - Ask questions
  - Talk about what you're thinking or doing as you're doing it. While leetcode. While practice system design.
  - If you need time to think that's okay, but just mention to the interviewer that you need a moment to think. Don't stay silent for too long though; even if you haven't quite figured out the answer start talking ("so I haven't quite figured this out, but here's what I'm thinking")
  - Smile, be positive. Even if you're not doing well. You might be doing better than you think! I have had interviews that I thought I bombed but they were intentionally very difficult to see how I thought and handled the challenge. Staying positive served me well.
