<h1 style="text-align: center">Interviewing Etiquette</h1>

- Shocked by how poorly many engineers comport themselves during interviews
- Learn good interview etiquette and you will automatically have a leg up
- No one wants to work with a jerk. If you have the choice between being a technical savant but a jerk and being technically compenent but a wonderful person, be the latter.
- Etiquette:
  - Show up on time
  - Always thank people for anything they do for you
  - Smile, be gracious
  - Don't be judgmental
  - Over-communicate
  - Stay positive
  - Be honest
  - Ask (good) questions
  - Know about the company, its values, and if possible what you'll be working on
