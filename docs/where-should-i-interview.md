# Where Should I Interview?

Where you should interview depends a lot on your personal preferences. Are you intent the "prestige" of a FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) company? Or big tech? Or do you explicitly _not_ want to be in a big tech company? Do you want to avoid doing Leetcode-style interviews?

FAANG and big tech companies tend to do Leetcode-style interviews. If you don't want to do Leetcode, look elsewhere. If you're considering a company, [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/) is your friend! Use it to look up ratings and interview processes at a potential employer.

If you're interested in what salary you might make at a company, use [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi). It crowd-sources salary information from company employees.

If you're ever on the fence about applying or interviewing somewhere, my advice is to go for it! Worse case, you get some great practice. Best case, you get an offer and either accept it or use it as leverage against another offer.
