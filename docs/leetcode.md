# Leetcode-Style Interviews

## What are Leetcode-style interviews?

Leetcode-style interviews are probably the most infamous type of software development interview out there. In these interviews, you're given an algorithm/data structure challenge that you have to solve either on a whiteboard or computer. The interviewer is judging your coding, critical thinking, communication, and problem solving skills. Often, you're expected to communicate decisions and tradeoffs you're making and discuss the time and space complexity of your solution.

While many companies (especially big tech companies) conduct Leetcode-style interviews, it's important to recognize that many other companies _don't_ perform these kinds of interviews. [This Github repo](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards) has a list of companies that don't perform Leetcode-style interviews. Additionally, if you're interested in a company and are curious as to whether the do Leetcode-style interviews, be sure to check out the interview section of their [Glassdoor](https://glassdoor.com) page. If you're really uncomfortable with the idea of algorithm and data structure challenges, you can definitely find great jobs where you don't have to solve these puzzles.

## How you're evaluated

It's common to panic and think "I must find the optimal solution" when facing a Leetcode-style problem. In my experience, this isn't the case. I had one FAANG interview where I think I provided the optimal solution for maybe one out of the four Leetcode-style problems but _still_ got the job offer.

While it's impossible to generalize this _too_ much (companies vary), you're usually assess on the following topics:

- **Coding ability.** Do you have a good grasp of control flow and logic? Can you write code relatively quickly and is it well-formated? Do you name variables logically?
- **Algorithms/data structures.** Do you use algorithms and data structures appropriately? How optimal was the space and time complexity of your solution? Did you correctly assess the space and time complexity?
- **Communication.** Did you explain your work well? Did you ask clarifying questions? Did you talk to tradeoffs? Can you explain technical concepts? Were you closed off or rude?
- **Problem solving skills.** Did you take time to understand the question and ask the right clarifying questions? Did you give the interviewer the impression that you'd be rigorous in approaching new challenges?

As you can see, the algorithms and data structure part is just a small piece of the puzzle. At least for me, this was a big load off my mind: of course you should try to do your best to come up with an optimal solution, but you can get pretty far by honing you skill in some of these other areas.

## How to prepare for Leetcode-style interviews

- Most well-known, most feared interview type
- While many big tech companies do leetcode, plenty of other companies do not. If you just really don't want to do leetcode, then don't do it. (hiring without whiteboards link?)
- Reframe your relationship with this type of interview
  - It's possible the company will fail you if you don't get the absolute optimal solution, but that hasn't been my experience. They want to know how you think and how you communicate.
- Understand what the interviewer is looking for

  - Collaborate or problem-solve
  - Write tests?
  - Use internet?

- Big O notation

- How to study
  - Use Glassdoor
  - DS&A course if necessary
  - Blind 75, neetcode 150
  - Pay for leetcode
