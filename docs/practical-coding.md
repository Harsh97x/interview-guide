# Practical Coding Interviews

- Probably my personal favorite
- Build an app together (or something practical) with your interviewer
- Be very careful with requirements
- Understand what they're looking for
  - Do they want to collaborate (e.g., pair programming) or just watch you drive?
  - Do they want tests?
  - External libraries?
- Ask recruiter what environment you'll be using and practice using that
- Example problems
