# Submit Feedback

This guide is always a work in progress! I'd appreciate any input you have to make it better. The best ways to send me feedback are:

1. [Submit an issue on Github](https://github.com/nas5w/interview-guide/issues)
2. [Send me a DM on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nas5w) if you have less formal feedback or want to have a private conversation
