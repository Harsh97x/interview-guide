# Behavioral Interviews

## What is a behavioral interview?

Behavioral interviews gauge your soft and interpersonal skills rather than your technical accumen. Pretty much every company has a behavioral interview component. This is for some very good reasons:

- No one wants to work with a jerk
- Engineers often have to handle ambiguity
- Companies want engineers that perform well under stress

It has become increasing popular for companies to try to assess your _emotional intelligence_ and _empathy_ as well. They want to know that you can see things from other people's points of view and that you can negotiate tricky interpresonal relationships.

::: tip RESOURCE ALERT!
One of my favorite resources for behavioral interviews is [Jeff Sipe's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffHSipe). He's a former Google recruiter and does a great job talking about the kind of empathy and interpersonal skills tech companies look for. I highly recommend you watch some of his videos.

## Types of questions

There are two main types of behavioral interview questions I have come across:

- **Past experience.** These questions often start out with the phrase "Tell me about a time..." The interviewer expects you to provide an example of something that actually happened in your work (or academic) history.
- **Hypotheticals.** These questions are scenarios presented by the interviewer asking how you'd handle a made up situation. The interviewer wants you to _not_ provide an example from the past but rather come up with a solution to a problem they have provided you.

It's important to know which question you're being asked! Far too often people provide the wrong type of answer to one of these questions. When in doubt, _ask the interviewer_!

> "Would you like me to provide an example from my work history or are you interested in how I would solve this problem in the future if it arose?"

In the following sections, I'll tell you how to prepare for both of these types of interviews.

## Preparing for past experience questions

My favorite way to prepare for past experience questions is to make a table. There are a limited number of common themes in behavioral interviews:

- Challenges
- Successes
- Failures
- Things you enjoyed
- Leadership
- Conflicts

Those become the rows of my table. The columns are all the different projects I want to talk about. I try my best to come up with an example for each row from each project. Here's a fictitious completed table:

| Theme      | Project A                                                                                                         | Project B                                                                                      | Project C                                                                                                                                         |

| Challenges | Deployment process was a mess. I helped implement CD.                                                             | Team morale was low. I created social events and 1:1 calls.                                    | Complex, nested form logic shared between clients. I implemented JSON schema that could be consumed by various parties and used to validate data. |
| Successes  | Reduced average request time from 1.5s to 750ms.                                                                  | Handled exponential application growth from 1,000 requests per day to 50,000 requests per day. | The product beta launched with 1,000 users. customers.                                                                                            |
| Failures   | I pushed code to production that formatted dates incorrectly and caused an API endpoint to fail on every request. | N/A                                                                                            | Mismanaged relationship between tech team and partner tech teams caused some partners to back out.                                                |
| Enjoyed    | Teaching developers about CD.                                                                                     | My first exposure to CDNs and rapid scaling. Really enjoyed learning about this subject area.  | I got to sit in on user research. Was really interesting to see how users actually use the software.                                              |
| Leadership | I had to present my vision for better engineering practices to the CTO.                                           | No one was an infrastructure specialist so I stepped up to lead that area.                     | N/A                                                                                                                                               |
| Conflicts  | Some senior engineers were resistant to the changes I was proposing so I had to convince them in 1:1s and demos.  | N/A                                                                                            | Team members could not come to consensus on data schema validation method. I championed a process to use a structured design document.            |

### Quantify!

Be sure to quantify your successes. Many organizations are data-driven and expect you to be as well. If possible try to tie your successes to revenue generated or, if not possible, tie your successes to something known to be correlated with revenue generated.

### Be careful with negatives

Explain all problems and challenges with _empathy_. For example, if you had to deal with a disgruntled colleague, make sure you don't describe that person as "bad" but rather that they must have been going through a tough time.

### Talk about lessons learned

Companies will likely ask you about mistakes or failures. All of us have made mistakes, but not all of us learn from them. Whenever you talk about your mistakes, make sure to talk about lessons you learned from those mistakes and, if you were able to take corrective action in the moment, talk about that too.
