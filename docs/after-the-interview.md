<h1 style="text-align: center">Communication After the Interview</h1>

- Send an email thanking the recruiter and saying you look forward to hearing back. Even if you don't think you did well (you'd be surprised!)
- Gently follow-ups are good on a weekly basis unless the recruiter gave you a different timeline
- May ask you for more interviews
- May schedule you to talk to the HM (either for the first time or again)
  - This is a very good sign
- Handling rejections
  - Typically rejections are form emails, in my experience
  - Ask if you can have feedback. Many companies will not give you feedback. That's okay. If they will give you feedback, take it! An incredible opportunity to do better in the future.
- Handling offers
  - Congratulations! This topic is a bit out of scope for this handbook. Try to have multiple offers at the same time for negotiating power. If possible, try to find out how well you did in the interviews. Some recruiters will tell you that you really knocked the interview out of the park, meaning they want you and you can negotiate more.
