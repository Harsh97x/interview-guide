# System Design Interviews

- One of the best barometers for more senior developers (often not included for more junior developers)
- Typically given a poorly-defined problem and you have to work out a solution
- You must spend time up front clarifying the problem
- Ask if it's well-specified enough
- Architecture
  - Most detail on your domain, less elsewhere
  - Typically they won't have you focus on a different domain (e.g., not too much frontend discussion if you're backend and vice versa)
- Drill-down

Example problems

- Find some examples and discuss them
