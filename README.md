# Interview Guide

Welcome to my [interview guide](https://interviewguide.dev)!

My name is Nick and I'm a senior software engineer at Microsoft. I have participated in around 100 software engineering interviews on both sides of the table&mdash;as a candidate and an interviewer. I have passed interviews at both big tech/FAANG companies as well as smaller startups.

This guide is my attempt to codify my opinionated interview process for the benefit of the software development community.

## Making suggestions or contributing

I'm always open to suggestions! However, since this guide represents my specific process for interview prep, I might be hesitant to include resources that I haven't actually used. Still, if you would like to make suggestions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nas5w/interview-guide/issues) so we can discuss.
